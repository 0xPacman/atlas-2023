	"description": "Bonjwa is a group of German streamers, Youtubers, and podcasters. The picture shows a recent meme of Matteo (1.5 meters wide) in the centre and the logo on the right-hand side. Also, TouristHistories is depicted just alongside the logo sitting on a chair. She is also a streamer and was shortly part of the Bonjwa team. On the left-hand side, there is Peepo, the dog of Leon (redpanda). Between Matteo and Peepo is Marius, or Fischersnet, who streams regularly with Bonjwa and was part of the original meme.",
