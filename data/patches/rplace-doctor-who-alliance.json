	"description": "An Alliance formed by individual and small community around the Tardis after it was forced to warp away from it's formal location.\n\nAs the Tardis warps in just before the first expansion, Flat Eric and Tiny Python also appears near by.\n\nWe were weary of the flag forming, we thought it was Colombia, but it turns out to be Ecuador!\n\nAfter shuffling among ourselves, a rough alliance was formed that lasted till the end.\n\nwe had about 6 hours of peace before Canary Islands appears, asking to take the old spot where Ecuador was.\n\nEven though they promised to not take any of our alliance members, they ate Flat Eric!\n\nAfter about 9 hours when the alliance members came back and saw what happened, we broke Flat Eric out of the belly of the Canary Islands and found a Ms.Flat Eric too\n\nJust in time for the second expansion too.\n\nPeace didn't last long though, after just 4.5 hours, We got attacked by a whole bunch of group, all at the same time, wave after wave, from the Canary Islands, minecraft(?), Kruishoutem(?) and French Streamer!\n\nJetlag and others came to our help to fight off the French Streamer and we managed to push them back without the Tardis ever disappearing during the whole war.\n\nAfter which, we got a few small attack here and there but it's mostly peaceful till the very end.",
