	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its flag is known as the Taegeukgi.\n\nSweden provided asylum for Koreans while they were flag-less soon after their third elimination by a rogue Swede, the first elimination perpetrated by CyrusTwo, and the latter two by perrababy. However, this was followed by perrababy’s attack on Korea, Sweden, Sami, and Denmark on the final day, making this perrababy’s third overall elimination of a Korean flag for this year. This conflict dragged in the UK, which supported their allies’ defense against perrababy due to the Greggs war. Fortunately by the time of perrababy’s third attack, Korea had survived through the UK and France, therefore was not completely eliminated as was the case after his first two attacks. Sweden, Denmark, and Sami were rebuilt before the ending of place, though not to their pre-attack designs.",
