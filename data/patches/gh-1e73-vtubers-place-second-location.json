	"description": "The VTubers Place Discord server is a Discord location of dedicated VTuber fans established in 2022 for the r/place event that year.\nThis location contains lots of builds of the VTuber community, but also a lot of allied communities, such as Chelsea FC, Sabaton + Warthunder + Battefield, Star Wars Turkey, The Final Clean and more.\n\nWhen r/place began, the original location of the VTubers Place artwork was next to the Turkish flag. Eventually they were forced to move, due to expansions of the Azerbaijani and Turkish flags over their artworks and the wish for a strong alliance with Germany. This is their second location and the longest surviving.",
