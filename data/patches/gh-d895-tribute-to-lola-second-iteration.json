	"description": "Lola was a little girl who was tortured and killed by an illegal algerian migrant. This tribute is in his honor. Since some right wing politicians have used her image to promote their agenda back in 2022, far left extremists have denounced this tribute as being political (without any evidence for it) and started pretending the parents were against this tribute. The parents did not ask not to use this drawing (used at the commemoration march by the family, by the way), but not to associate a political party with it during the tributes. People of diverse political affiliations and backgrounds have worked together to honor her. Nonetheless, these extremists spread misinformation to German streamers to trick them into raiding the tribute. This is the second tribute done to her before it was moved alltogether",
