	"description": "In the 2017 and 2022 r/place events, there were no signs of the cheese communities creating a monumental piece. So in 2023 u/Cheesus_Cakus decided to draw a piece of cheese despite having a small community and a newly created subreddit dedicated to this. This piece signifies that when necessary, Cheesers can accomplish this challenging task through collaboration. This artwork was achieved through diplomatic negotiations with PlaceDE.",
