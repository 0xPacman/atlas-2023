	"description": "Mastermovies is the stage name of a former duo consisting of Paul Huig and Merijn Scholte Albers. They are mainly known for the so-called fundubs in which they dubbed films and television series, often humorous texts unrelated to the original film or series. They left a profound impact on the humor and in-jokes of a specific generation, as their videos are very quotable.",
