	"description": "Eekum Bokum is a meme showing Inugami Korone (left) responding cutely to the \"Eekum bokum\" phrase spoken by the skull (right). \"Eekum Bokum\" is stated when a character picks up a Mumbo token (skull) in the 1998 video game Banjo-Kazooie. \n\nOn August 25th, 2020, Hololive Vtuber Inugame Korone played the game during a live stream and was amused by the sound clip, repeating it whenever it played during the game. Three days later, an animator, \"2ManySnacks\", posted a three-second video of Korone and the mumbo coin repeating the \"Eekum bokum\" phrase to YouTube. The video quickly became viral, garnering over 3 million views in about 3 weeks, which spawned multiple memes and edits.",
