	"description": "Gabibbo is an Italian mascot for the television channel Canale 5, created in 1990 by Antonio Ricci. \nGabibbo's main role has been in the programs Paperissima and Striscia la notizia. \nGabibbo quickly gained popularity among viewers due to its unique appearance and comedic antics. The character's success led to various merchandise and spin-offs, making it a well-recognized figure beyond television.  \nOver the years, Gabibbo became more than just a character: it became a cultural icon, representing Italian humor and satire. It has been referenced in various media, memes, and pop culture, further solidifying its iconic status. \n\nUnfortunately, just like last year, Gabibbo has been removed either by admins or bots, because some funny Gabibbo fans (Besughi) started drawing a phallic shaft under his head, with \"random colored pixels\" spurting from the tip. In this Atlas, you can still see the remainders of this phenomenon in the frames surrounding his removal.",
