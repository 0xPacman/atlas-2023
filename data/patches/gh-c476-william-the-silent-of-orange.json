	"description": "William the Silent of Orange or William the Taciturn (24 April 1533 - 10 July 1584), known in Dutch as Willem van Oranje or Willem de Zwijger, was a leader of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs that set off the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648). In 1581, as part of the war, the Dutch rebels gained independence and formed the United Provinces, precursor state to the Netherlands. Because of this, he is nicknamed \"Father of the Fatherland\" in the Netherlands.\n\nThe salute is based on an emote in the PlaceNL Discord server, which in turn was an edit of the William the Silent of Orange art on the 2022 canvas.",
