	"description": "A shark was created by the private LuschenServer Discord community (a group of friends). Creators of the Chilean flag attempted to invade the shark, but its defenders managed to protect it. Subsequently, the shark was modified to appear as though it was biting into the Chilean flag. The aim was to design a shark with an exceptionally elongated body, fondly referred to as a 'longboy' or 'longshork'. Although the event 'r/place' concluded before the 'longshork' could reach its intended size, it still achieved a respectable length.",
