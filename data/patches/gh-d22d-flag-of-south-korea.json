	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its flag is known as the Taegeukgi.\n\nThis flag was involved in the Perrababy-Greggs war at its final moment, resisting a large, rouge Swedish streamer called Perrababy who insisted on expanding over the flag as well as the Greggs logo built by r/UKOnPlace who the South Korea formed a strong alliance with. The flag was later moved to the main UK flag.",
