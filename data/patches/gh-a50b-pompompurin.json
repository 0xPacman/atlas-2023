	"description": "Pompompurin is a good-natured Golden Retriever dog character introduced by the Japanese company Sanrio in 1996. Purin was born on a sunny day on April 16th. Pompompurin lives in his own basket in the entrance hall of his sister-owner's house. His trademark is his brown beret that is always on top of his head. Pompompurin's favorite food is his mama's pudding.\n\nThis image was written by a bot net.\nIf you compared this image with \ninfamous hacker from BreachForums, and that seems to be no coincidence.",
