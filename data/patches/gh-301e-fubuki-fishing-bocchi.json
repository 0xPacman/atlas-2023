	"description": "The Hololive affiliated VTuber Shirakami Fubuki (Japanese naming order) fishing a depiction of the Bocchi The Rock character Hitori Gotou (also Japanese naming order), commonly referred to as simply \"Bocchi\". Bocchi is in \"blob\" depiction here. The artwork is a collaboration between the Bocchi The Rock and VTubers Place Discord servers.\nOriginally, the artwork had Fubuki fishing a \"Takodachi\", the companion character of another Hololive VTuber Ninomae Ina'nis, but this was changed quickly before building began into Bocchi by request of one of the VTubers Place members. The reason behind this collaboration was the (at that time) sparse presence of the Bocchi The Rock characters on the canvas and a close relationship between the two communities because of the close proximity of their original starting locations on the initial canvas (next to the Turkish flag).",
