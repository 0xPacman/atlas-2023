	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its flag is known as the Taegeukgi.\n\nThis fourth flag of r/Korea_Place was involved in the Greggs-Korea vs. Perrababy war at its final moment, repeatedly resisting a large, rouge Swedish streamer called Perrababy who insisted on expanding over the flag as well as the Greggs logo, which was built by r/UKOnPlace who the South Korea formed a strong alliance with. The flag was later moved to the main UK flag.",
