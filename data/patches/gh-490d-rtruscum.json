	"description": "The term \"truscum\" is a portmanteau of \"true\" and \"scum\" and is used to describe a specific viewpoint within the transgender community. Truscum individuals are those who believe that a person must experience gender dysphoria and undergo medical transition (such as hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery) to be considered truly transgender. Some believe that non-binary identies are not recognised as a valid gender.\n\n[Entry edited under discussion with member of the trans community, please discuss an edit on our discord]",
