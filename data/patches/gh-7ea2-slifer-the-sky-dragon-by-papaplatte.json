	"description": "This piece of art was created in a short period of time right after the canvas extension. This dragon is a Yu-Gi-Oh! card. The well known streamer xQc attacked the middle of the canvas and after Papaplatte's defense xQc sent his viewers to destroy this (Papaplatte's) dragon. The german discord and other streamers helped to defend the dragon. Because of the huge amount of people the dragon's pixels even froze for a short time. It was a very epic battle which resulted in a cooperation of xQc and Papaplatte.",
