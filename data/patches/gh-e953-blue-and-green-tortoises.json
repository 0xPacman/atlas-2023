The german community from r/placeDE, helding the flag behind the tortoises, first decided to keep them. The tortoises were replaced by one of the last artworks of the r/placeDE community, the \"Geschwister Scholl\". However, some tortoises on the very left of the flag made it to the final canvas.",
