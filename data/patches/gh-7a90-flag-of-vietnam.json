On it also are 3 the iconic images including: \"Chim Lạc\" - Vietnamese mythical bird, Immaculate Conception Cathedral Basilica (Nhà thờ chính tòa Đức Bà Sài Gòn) and Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (Lăng Chủ tịch Hồ Chí Minh), which are famous architectural works of historical, cultural and religious significance in Vietnam. At first, One Pillar Pagoda (Chùa Một Cột) was built first on the flag, but got replaced with Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum later.\nOn July 21, around 20:00 GMT, Vietnam flag got raided by Twitch streamers Punz and GrandPooBear.
