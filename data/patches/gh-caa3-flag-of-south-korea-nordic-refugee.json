	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its flag is known as the Taegeukgi.\n\nThis asylum was provided to Koreans by r/sweden and r/place_nordicunion as compensation for the previous Korean flag being eliminated by a rogue Swedish streamer called Perrababy, who was not part of the Nordic Union. Unfortunately, another rogue Swedish hivemind, not aware of or affiliated with the Union, seemed to dislike this decision and eventually succeeded in removing this flag after continuous greifing. Luckily, despite this flag being taken down, Korea had survived through the UK and France until the ending of r/place.",
