	"description": "Canada is a country in North America sharing the largest land border in the world along with the United States. This was the original flag location of r/placecanada but was later abandoned and dubbed the \"decoy flag\" after bots from the 1337 coding school took over and constantly overwrote any changes made to it. After all other Canadian flag locations got destroyed r/placecanada returned and managed to get a new flag set up with the help of Germany and Touhou.",
