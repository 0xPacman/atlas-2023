	"description": "Cody, formerly designated CC-2224, was a male Clone Marshal Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic who commanded the 7th Sky Corps—including its renowned subunit the 212th Attack Battalion—during the Clone Wars. He served as the second-in-command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi within the Third Systems Army and the 7th Sky Corps. \n\nIn the Battle of Utapau , Cody carried out an action that proved to be his most enduring legacy: he was the man to order Kenobi's death, albeit not by choice. The Clone Commander received a transmission from Darth Sidious, who instructed him to execute Order 66.",
