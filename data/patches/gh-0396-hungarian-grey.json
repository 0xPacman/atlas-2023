{"id":-1,"name":"Hungarian Grey","description":"The Hungarian Gray Cow, or \"Magyar Sz√ºrke Szarvasmarha,\" is a native breed deeply rooted in Hungary's history. Bred by the Magyar tribes who settled in the Carpathian Basin, these cows played a vital role in Hungarian agriculture for centuries. With their stunning appearance, sturdy frames, and adaptability, they were essential in providing milk for dairy products and aiding in farm work. However, modernization and foreign breeds threatened their existence. Recognizing their cultural significance, Hungary implemented conservation efforts, ensuring the Hungarian Gray Cow remains a living heritage, symbolizing the nation's commitment to preserving its agricultural traditions and cultural identity.","links":{"website":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grey"]},"path":{"248-256":[[-1353,-7],[-1352,-8],[-1352,-9],[-1351,-10],[-1351,-11],[-1350,-12],[-1350,-19],[-1351,-20],[-1351,-21],[-1352,-22],[-1352,-23],[-1353,-24],[-1353,-27],[-1354,-28],[-1354,-31],[-1356,-31],[-1358,-33],[-1356,-35],[-1355,-35],[-1356,-36],[-1358,-36],[-1361,-39],[-1361,-40],[-1360,-41],[-1359,-41],[-1358,-40],[-1356,-40],[-1355,-39],[-1354,-39],[-1352,-37],[-1346,-37],[-1344,-39],[-1343,-39],[-1342,-40],[-1340,-40],[-1339,-41],[-1338,-41],[-1337,-40],[-1337,-39],[-1340,-36],[-1342,-36],[-1343,-35],[-1342,-35],[-1340,-33],[-1320,-33],[-1319,-32],[-1318,-32],[-1313,-27],[-1313,-21],[-1315,-19],[-1315,-18],[-1316,-17],[-1315,-17],[-1314,-18],[-1313,-17],[-1315,-15],[-1316,-15],[-1318,-17],[-1318,-22],[-1317,-23],[-1317,-26],[-1318,-27],[-1318,-28],[-1318,-25],[-1319,-24],[-1319,-16],[-1320,-15],[-1320,-13],[-1319,-12],[-1319,-9],[-1320,-8],[-1320,-7],[-1321,-6],[-1327,-6],[-1328,-7],[-1325,-10],[-1325,-13],[-1326,-14],[-1327,-14],[-1330,-17],[-1331,-16],[-1332,-17],[-1337,-17],[-1338,-18],[-1340,-18],[-1340,-10],[-1339,-9],[-1339,-7],[-1340,-6],[-1343,-6],[-1344,-7],[-1343,-8],[-1343,-9],[-1344,-10],[-1344,-12],[-1345,-13],[-1345,-14],[-1345,-13],[-1346,-12],[-1346,-11],[-1347,-10],[-1347,-9],[-1348,-8],[-1348,-7],[-1349,-6],[-1352,-6]]},"center":{"248-256":[-1344,-25]}}
