While attempting to black out the head of the dragon, who's creation was lead by Papaplatte (another twitch streamer), at 1200 630, xQc organized the attack by sorting his viewers into different sections of the art by the day of the month they were born on. \n\nWhile drawing out the sections on his stream, xQc divided it into 32 sections, despite there being no more than 31 days in the longest months.\n\nThe entire community of r/place retaliated against xQc's attacks by putting \"32?\" on the Charizard card, which xQc led the creation of, in order to question his competence.",
