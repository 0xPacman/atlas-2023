	"description": "An artwork from the German r/muemmler_iel community, using to share pictures and more or less relevant information about rodents and lagomorpha.\n\nThe word \"Mümmler\" translates as \"those who mumble\". In the early 2020ish years, some members of r/ich_iel (German r/me_irl) used to post small mumbling mammals to celebrate Monday (\"Es ist Montag, meine Mümmler.\", that is: \"It is monday, my mumblers.\"). In early 2022, this ritual was no longer desired by r/ich_iel leading the mumbler-lovers to split off. They decided to create their own community where they could post guinea pigs, rabbits and hamsters every day of the week.",
