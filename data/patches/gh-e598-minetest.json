Minetest was created in 2010 by Perttu \"celeron55\" Ahola and was inspired by games like Minecraft and Infiniminer, at first it was a simple Minecraft-like survival game but as it evolved, it became a multipurpose engine allowing for the creation of original games. The logo was created on the Windows Vista taskbar by the PlaceMinetest group founded by Migdyn in 2022.",
