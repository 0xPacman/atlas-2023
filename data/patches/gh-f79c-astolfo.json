	"description": "Originating from the Japanese light novel and anime series \"Fate/Apocrypha,\" Astolfo is depicted as a male character, but his appearance and personality have led to the \"femboy\" interpretation within fandoms. The pixel art was created by r/astolfo and r/femboy. They were also allied with r/Overlord, who helped defend each other and repair after attacks.",
