	"description": "BitCraft is a sandbox massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) which encourages many different play styles ranging from farming, hunting, and crafting to city-building and social strategy, rather than emphasizing combat alone. The game incorporates elements of sub-genres such as survival games, sandbox games, role-playing games, city builders, and strategy games.\n\nAccording to information obtained in diplomatic discussions the BitCraft community had tried to build their artwork several times on the original canvas, but were kicked out every time. The second to last location was right underneath where the final Nijisanji logo's rainbow part would be built. The final location of this logo is one that was obtained through diplomatic discussions with the VTubers Place discord server's diplomats and is on the old location where VTubers Place's VShojo logo used to be before they moved to the newly expanded canvas to the west.",
