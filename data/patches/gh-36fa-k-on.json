	"description": "\"K-On!\" is a delightful and heartwarming anime that follows the adventures of five high school girls forming a band in their light music club. The story centers around Yui Hirasawa, a carefree girl with no musical experience, who joins the club at Sakuragaoka High School. Together with talented Mio, enthusiastic Ritsu, wealthy Tsumugi, and shy but talented Azusa, they bond over music and friendship. Originally aired in 2009, this anime became a massive hit and remains immensely popular to this day.\nThe five girls are also depicted on the top of this artwork, above the text. From left to right they are: Ritsu, Mio, Yui, Asuza and Mugi. Asuza is depicted with catears, as a hairband with catears is often placed on her head unexpectedly by several of the characters in the anime. It is also the only way to distinguish her from Mio in a 3x3 pixelart form...\n\nThis artwork was made by a (possibly bunch of) dedicated fans of K-On! from the Bocchi The Rock Discord server. Originally the artwork was built where Fubuki fishing Bocchi would end up, so the VTuber community reserved the final spot for K-On! above the VShojo logo.",
