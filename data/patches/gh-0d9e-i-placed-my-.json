	"description": "\"I placed my pickle\" is a meme that was created internally by the r/osuplace community during the event. One of the main coordinators, Emanfman, mispronounced \"pixel\" and said \"pickle\" instead, so #verified-chat started to meme it. The image itself is featuring Taiga from the 2008 anime Toradora. The meme along with many others was used to give confirmation to the osu! Logo Builders discord stage channel that one has placed their pixel and is now on cooldown.",
