	"description": "Crying Gigachad Yagoo is a pixel art of Motoaki Tanigo (aka Yagoo), the CEO of Cover Corporation, the parent company of Hololive. Yagoo is depicted crying with the body of Ernest Khalimov (aka Gigachad). The edit is a meme showing the CEO's vulnerability despite his apparent prowess.\n\nWithin the Hololive fan community, Yagoo is revered as a beloved CEO with a soft and shy demeanour, contrasting the stereotype of a typical company executive. Yagoo is shown as a gigachad for his ability to grow a stable company within a turbulent industry. \n\nYagoo is shown crying because, in an interview with the media, he once envisioned Hololive as an idol group for the virtual world. The statement quickly became a meme due to the behaviour of his talents, which was opposite to what was expected of a typical idol group in Japan.",
