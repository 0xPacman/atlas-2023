	"description": "This was originally a red tendril from the void mother below this piece, however it was repeatedly driven back by the members of the Fuck Spez Coalition, who were of the belief that the area should remain black for better contrast.\n\nA disagreement occurred in the FSC, as some members believed that there were more pressing matters to attend over attacking this. In addition, rather than attacking the void, they believed an alliance should be formed, so that it could be used to curate the black around the FuckSpez sign, on the FSC's behalf.\n\nFSC command disagreed with this view, and the orders were issued to destroy the tendril and drive it back. Seeing that defense of the existing tendril was hopeless, the \"Red Corkscrew\" was formed, in defiance of FSC command.\n\nUnlike the original, this piece started from the top and worked downwards - in the hopes of avoiding the attention of the FSC until it could reconnect with the void mother.\n\nAlso unlike the original, it respected a 1px boundary with the letters on either side, in recognition of the FSC's desire to keep the contrast on the letters.\n\nIt was noticed and attacked a number of times, however each time it was rebuilt until being subsumed by the void mother's tendril from below, thus fulfilling its purpose.\n",
