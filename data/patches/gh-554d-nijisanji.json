	"description": "NIJISANJI is a VTuber agency featuring a variety of talented influencers who create exciting content. The objective of this project is to accelerate the beginning of the next generation of entertainment through various activities and services such as events, goods and digital content, original music, etc. Currently, over 200 VTubers are active, regularly creating unique content on various video streaming platforms such as YouTube.\n\nThis specific icon was planned by Vtubers Place and the Task Bar to be added, however an unaffiliated group mistakenly placed it over the location that was allocated for Senko's Lab. VTubers Place and the Senko community eventually coordinated to relocate the icon to its intended location while also building the Senko's Lab icon in its rightful place.",
