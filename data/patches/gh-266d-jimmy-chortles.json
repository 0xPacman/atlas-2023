	"description": "What began as a joke among three friends who accidentally popped a balloon became a much more widespread inside jokes between a history teacher and every one of his classes. The balloon is currently memorialized through a photo frame with its remnants and numerous drawings of the balloon itself in the classroom. Lovingly nicknamed \"Jimmy Chortles\", the balloon represents the deep connection many students had with their beloved history teacher, Mr. V. The students formerly worked with numerous groups to allow the balloon to stay, but ultimately has had to move 5 times. People in r/placeDE noticed the drawing and fiercely fought for it to stay. Here is Jimmy Chortles' final resting place and foothold in internet history.",
