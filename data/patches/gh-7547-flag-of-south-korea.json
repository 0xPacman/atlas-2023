	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its national flag is known as Taegeukgi.\n\nThis was the second complete flag of r/Korea_Place this year. After prevailing over rogue individuals trying to convert it to a Japanese one, a few K-pop communities—including r/red_velvet and r/twice—subsequently relocated to its vicinity and established a loose Korea-themed coalition. The flag was eventually consumed by Cuba.",
