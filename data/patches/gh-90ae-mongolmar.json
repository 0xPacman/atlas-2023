	"description": "This sprite of Magmar, a Fire-type Pokémon from the Pokémon games, is a private joke in the community of content creator Fildrong. Mongolmar was implemented a few years ago as a emote on the Team Sale Discord server to express stupidity and cluelessness, mostly to give off a lighthearted feel to a message. He comes from a Nuzlocke series based on a randomised version of Pokémon Platinum, where the sprite was taken from.\n\nThis spot was to be stolen by Opera GX, as stated by a Tweet on their official page, Friday midday, but was ultimately taken over by the Fildrong community.",
