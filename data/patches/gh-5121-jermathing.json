	"description": "jermaThing, also known as The Thing face, is a meme and emote on American steamer and creator Jerma985's channel, originating from his \"The Thing\" stream (from 21st October, 2019). He made the original face when he almost died due to not paying attention to his surroundings, which would have resulted in having to do a tough boss fight again. Someone then edited it into what we see now. This version is the first of two completed 'jermaThings', both done with the alliance of r/furry_irl. Another is created later on July 24 and lasts until the whiteout.",
