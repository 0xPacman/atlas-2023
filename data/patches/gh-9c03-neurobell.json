	"description": "NeuroBell is an emote from the AI-powered VTuber Neuro-sama who streams on Twitch. It was built in collaboration with the Neuro-sama and VTubers place Discord servers. The emote was/is commonly used in the Neuro-sama discord server when making announcements about r/place or in general. A diplomatic contact from the VTubers Place community liked the emote so much that he got a pixelart version made by one of their artists and got it on the template. It was the first thing the VTubers Place community finished on their fourth location on the final canvas expansion.\n\nThe little green thing on her head is a turtle and represents Neuro-sama's creator Vedal, who uses a tiny turtle as his own VTuber avatar when he streams together with Neuro-sama. It was originally not on the artwork as it does not appear on the original emote. However, it was suggested and designed by people in the Neuro-sama Discord server and added to the template shortly after. ",
