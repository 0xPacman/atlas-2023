	"description": "This small area depicts a TARDIS, surrounded by a multicoloured scarf (belonging to the fourth doctor), a sonic screwdriver (belonging to the eleventh and twelfth doctors) and the number 60 (due to the fact that 2023 marks the 60th anniversary of the first Doctor Who episode broadcast on 23/11/63). Unrelated to Doctor Who, but related to the team behind this area, there is a small Python logo and two purple hearts. While the purple hearts themselves are unrelated to Doctor Who, the number of them represents the two hearts that The Doctor (and all Time Lords) have.",
