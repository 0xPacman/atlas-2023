	"description": "The article, which comprises four paragraphs, was designed to prevent crises like those that occurred under the Fourth Republic. Its best-known provision, paragraph 3 (Article 49.3), allows the government to force passage of a law without a vote, unless the parliament passes a motion of no confidence.\nIt's widely known during the pension reform of March 2023 because the government used it to pass the reform using this article. This led to massive strikes in the country for a long period.",
