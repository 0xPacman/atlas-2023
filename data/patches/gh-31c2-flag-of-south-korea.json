	"description": "South Korea is a country in East Asia. Its national flag is known as Taegeukgi.\n\nThe establishment of a small K-pop alley in the vicinity led to this spot being selected as the third home of r/Korea_Place. The location was swiftly secured with the aid of r/KPOPplace, and particularly r/twice. But issues arose when Korea attempted to make the flag symmetrical by expanding the left border by one pixel, which went into r/TUYU_official's territory. After brief moments of conflict and negotiation, TUYU yielded the line and an alliance that would last was formed.\n\nSoon, a small coalition of nearby factions has been established, including K-pop, TUYU, r/inabakukmori, and others. The Korean flag served as the coalition's common front line, successfully defending multiple aggression from a Turkish hivemind before the whole coalition eventually fell to a rogue Argentine streamer.",
