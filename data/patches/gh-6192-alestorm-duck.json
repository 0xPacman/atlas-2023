	"description": "Alestorm is a pirate-themed Power metal band based in Scotland. The duck has been seen as a mascot for the band since around 2019. Singer for Alestorm, Christopher Bowes, is also the Songwriter and studio keyboardist for Gloryhammer, so this design was made as alliance between members of r/Alestrom and members of r/PlaceGloryhammer, which is also why it is so close to Robot Prince of Auchtertool.",
