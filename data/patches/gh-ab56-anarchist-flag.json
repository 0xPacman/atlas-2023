	"description": "This is the third iteration of the red & black anarchist flag.\n\nAllying with r/yourturntodie and Witch Hat Atielier to the north, the Technoblade-memorial to the south and creating a safe haven for Infinity Train and the Poly Planter, this is the position the flag occupied the longest.\n\nHowever while the flag was here the community experienced significant conflict with the napoleonic-far-right faction as well as continued harassment from right wing libertarians and anticommunist. The Hammer-And-Sickle were especially difficult to maintain and on July the 24th redditors from the Napoleonic faction hacked a moderator account on their discord and proceeded to ban almost all members before the hacked account could be removed.\n\nThe community slowly rebuilt their discord from the ground up with the help of french socialists and continued to organize.\n\nThe discord link is omitted here for safety reasons.",
